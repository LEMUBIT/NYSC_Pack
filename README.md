# NYSC_Pack
The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is an organization set up by the Nigerian government
to involve the country's graduates in the development of the country.
NYSC Pack is a free mobile application specifically designed for Nigerian youth corpers. It is
designed to tackle the problems faced by serving youth corpers such as location of camps,
communication with other corp members, getting accommodation information and learning
about the city the corper was posted to. It is aimed at being a supplement and not a replacement of the official NYSC app on Google play.
